# Coordination Stories

This is a repo that will be collecting on short stories about coordination failure.  Which we then hope to publish as a beautfully designed printbook at ETHDenver 2023.

Hopes for these stories:
- This will be a handbook of coordination failures that increases the resolution of Moloch in general.
- We want to build a [pluriverse](https://pluriverse.wtf/) of stories.  
    - A diversity of stories from hyperlocal to global (gloabl north to global south, digital and physical).
    - Spanning public goods, tragedy of the commons, multipolar trapsâ€¦ but we should avoid generalization and emphasize real world example of Moloch manifestations
    - Stories about MOLOCH / coordination failure, but not in the camp of the weird/esoteric/off-putting, eg child sacrifice.
- Limited to 1 page or 3 paragraphs, to be accompanied by an image by Octavian (greenpill book designer).

# Next Steps
