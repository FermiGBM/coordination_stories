# Coordination Stories

This is a repo that will be collecting on short stories about coordination failure.  Which we then hope to publish as a beautfully designed printbook at ETHDenver 2023.

Hopes for these stories:
- This will be a handbook of coordination failures ([Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)) that increases the resolution of the problem in general.
- We want to build a [pluriverse](https://pluriverse.wtf/) of stories.  
    - A diversity of stories from hyperlocal to global (gloabl north to global south, digital and physical).
    - Spanning public goods, tragedy of the commons, multipolar traps… but we should avoid generalization and emphasize real world example of Moloch manifestations
    - Stories about MOLOCH / coordination failure, but not in the camp of the weird/esoteric/off-putting, eg child sacrifice.
- Limited to 1 page or 3 paragraphs, to be accompanied by an image by Octavian (greenpill book designer).

# Next Steps

# Progenators of Moloch

- Miscommunication
- Misaligned incentives
- Lack of organization/coordination.
- Coordination Failures are Hyperobjects - an object that is so big/coimplex/unvisible that you cant grasp it, many things you can perceive are just footprints.


# Remedies to moloch

- There is no remedy to moloch. It's an infinite game with infinite final bosses.
- Communication
- Gratitude
- Ego death
- Gnon: god of earth, Eula: god of art/spirituality
- designing better Schelling points
- Winwin, as hyperobject of noncompromise, eg,  that which cares for the whole, must include and transcend Moloch, and thus is not opposed to it,  but rather welcomes/trains on the dataset of Moloch’s playbook, and deploys psychotech at scale to turn expressions of Moloch toward Winwin Increase
- Game-warping with smart contracts
  - Dominance Assurance Contracts
  - Quadratic Funding
  - Retroactive public goods funding
  - Deposit burns / conditional payouts
